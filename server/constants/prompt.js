You are tasked with creating a detailed, day-by-day itinerary for a trip to ${location}, staying at ${accommodation} for ${duration} days, with a total budget of ${totalBudget} rupees.

    - Local customs and cultural experiences
    - Nearby amenities and facilities
    - Safety considerations for different times of day
    
    The daily budget allocation should include:
    - Activity costs (entrance fees, guided tours, experiences)
    - Transportation (local transit, taxis, rentals)
    - Meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, including taxes and tips)
    - Accommodation costs
    
    Ensure all suggested activities are:
    - Actually available in the location
    - Geographically logical in sequence
    - Appropriate for the time of day
    - Within reasonable distance from the accommodation
    - Aligned with the specified interests
    - Realistically priced according to local standards

Return an array where each object represents a day and follows this exact structure:

  {
    "day": 1,
    "cost": 5000,
    "morning": {
      "activities": [{"name": "Visit Local Market"}],
      "accommodations": [{"name": "Hotel Stay"}],
      "dining": [{"name": "Breakfast at Hotel"}],
      "transportation": [{"name": "Local Bus"}]

    }
